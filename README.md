## 🚀 Current Focus

- 🎧 **Latest Project:** Building **SynchCast** — a multi-Bluetooth audio broadcasting system for Windows that routes system audio to multiple output devices (Bluetooth, AUX, USB) simultaneously using virtual audio drivers.  
- 💬 **Previous Work:** Developed a **mental health chatbot** by fine-tuning LLaMA models to offer empathetic, AI-powered emotional support.  
- 📦 **Learning:** Exploring advanced **MLOps**, multi-user model serving, scalable deployment, and real-time audio processing.  
- 🤖 **Interests:** LLMs, system-level AI applications, audio engineering, and mental health innovation.  
- ⚡ **Fun Fact:** I love bridging deep tech with human-centered design to solve real-life problems.
